WHAT IS PULQUE?

Pulque is a collection of classes and scripts written in Ruby and Shell 
scripting to maintaining parallel development environments.

WHY?

Just because I want to keep myself sane. Why? Because:

At work I usually need to checkout different projects, most of them
stored in different version control systems, leading to a heterogeneous
folder filled of checkouts of different VCS, keeping track of what is what
is usually is hard. Besides that I need to keep parallel versions installed 
of the same application or library, keeping everything syncronized and clean 
is a mess. You are spending too much time trying to see what repository you 
are using and the current parallel environment running, you spend time 
focusing on something that is not really that important.

BINARY

- __premove : removes parallel environment
- pcreate : creates a new parallel environment
- pexists: requests existence of environment
- pdetect : detects what repository is using current path
- plist : lists parallel environments
