WHAT IS PULQUE?

Pulque is a collection of applications written in Ruby and Bash scripting to 
maintain parallel development environments. 

WHY?

Three reasons:
- I need to keep multiple versions installed of the same software,
- I need to know what Version Control System is used by the software, and the 
  most important
- I want to keep myself sane.

At work, I have to interact with different open source projects, most of them
use Subversion and Git, but some others use Bazaar and Mercurial. Keeping track
of the current parallel development environment and the VCS used by the software
can be exhausting.

You spend time focusing on something that shouldn't be that important: 
- Managing your parallel environments and,
- Keeping track of the VCS used by the software

Is easy to get confused when interacting with the repository, for example,
calling "svn update" when the software uses "git". *That* usually happens. 
Unless you are using an IDE that support Multiple Parallel Development 
Environments you will need the terminal to configure and build your projects.

Pulque shows you the "parallel environment name" and the "VCS type", in your 
bash prompt, and depending on the working directory it will update the 
information.
